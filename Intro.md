### Statistics 

I took IB Applications and Interpretations as my first introduction to statistics. However, the class itself does not prepare for understanding what statistics really is. You do the math, and solve a problem without knowing the theories or reasonings behind pulling functions out of the TI-84. As I continue on my path as a statistics major, I write down everything into this GitHub repository including work and some resources, to help me with my own coding practice. 

If this does go public in the future and helps someone out, I will be very glad, as teaching is a small passion of mine that will probably never be known. 

Thank you. 

*Note: What is included helps me understand more about Statistics, some things may be left out.
